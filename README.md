# drag-and-drop-example

This small React Native example code is trying to enable drag-and-drop between two [react-native-swiper](https://github.com/leecade/react-native-swiper) components. 
Inspiration to try this came from great Udemy cources: [Complete React Native and Redux Cource](https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-react-native-and-redux-course) and [React Native: Advanced Concepts](https://www.udemy.com/react-native-advanced/).

The problem at the moment is, that when you trying to drag 'You are The Best' text into the above swiper view, it is not visible. Dragging is working only in the current swiper component view.
Any help and advices are welcome, please!

UPDATE: in iOS this can be solved by setting overflow visible, but this is not supported in Android. Any ideas?

1.git clone https://github.com/henkkasoft/drag-and-drop-example.git

2.npm install

3.installing expo and project->open project (select folder)
